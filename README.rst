Python Packaging User Guide
===========================

The "Python Packaging User Guide" (PPUG) aims to be the authoritative
resource on how to package and install distributions in Python.

The guide is part of a larger effort to improve all of the packaging and
installation docs, including pip, setuptools, virtualenv, wheel, and
docs.python.org. Ultimately, users need more than a "guide" to feel confident
about the current tools. They need complete, accurate and inter-consistent
documentation across all the projects.

The guide is currently maintained by the "Python Packaging Authority" (PyPA).
It was forked from the “Hitchhikers Guide to Packaging” in March 2013, which was
maintained by Tarek Ziadé.  Thankyou Tarek for all your efforts in python
packaging.

The html version of the Guide is currently available online at readthedocs.org_.
