About 'Page Status'
===================

Each page, even this one, will state at the top whether it's "Complete" or
"Incomplete".  Admittedly, a binary distinction is not very precise, but most
pages will additionally offer a footnote to better explain what's not complete or wrong.

Also, each page will give a "Last Reviewed" date, wich will only be updated by a
:term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` member when a meaningful review
is done to determine the status.

Why do this? See `here
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/issue/8/please-make-the-last-edited-date-very#comment-6545169>`_.
