About the Guide
===============

The Guide is maintained by the :term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` and aims to be the authoritative resource on
how to release and install distributions in python.

The guide was originally forked from the "Hitchhikers Guide to Packaging" in
March 2013.


About 'Page Status'
===================

Each page, even this one, will state at the top whether it's "Complete" or
"Incomplete".  Admittedly, a binary distinction is not very precise, but most
pages will additionally offer a footnote to better explain what's not complete or wrong.

Also, each page will give a "Last Reviewed" date, wich will only be updated by a
:term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` member when a meaningful review
is done to determine the status.

Why do this? See `here
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/issue/8/please-make-the-last-edited-date-very#comment-6545169>`_.
