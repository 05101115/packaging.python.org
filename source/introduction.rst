About the Guide
===============

The guide aims to be the authoritative resource on how to package and install
distributions in Python.

The guide is part of a larger effort to improve all of the packaging and
installation docs, including :ref:`pip`, :ref:`setuptools`, :ref:`virtualenv`,
and :ref:`wheel`. Ultimately, users need more than a "guide" to feel confident
about the current tools. They need complete, accurate and inter-consistent
documentation across all the projects.

The guide is currently maintained by the :term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority
(PyPA)>`.  It was forked from the “Hitchhikers Guide to Packaging” in March
2013, which was maintained by Tarek Ziadé.  Thankyou Tarek for all your efforts
in python packaging.


About 'Page Status'
===================

Each page, even this one, will state at the top whether it's "Complete" or
"Incomplete".  Admittedly, a binary distinction is not very precise, but most
pages will additionally offer a footnote to better explain what's not complete or wrong.

Also, each page will give a "Last Reviewed" date, wich will only be updated by a
:term:`PyPA <Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)>` member when a meaningful review
is done to determine the status.

Why do this? See `here
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/issue/8/please-make-the-last-edited-date-very#comment-6545169>`_.
