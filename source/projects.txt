`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distlib>`_

Distlib is a library which implements low-level functions that relate to
packaging and distribution of Python software.  It consists in part of the
functions in the packaging Python package, which was intended to be released as
part of Python 3.3, but was removed shortly before Python 3.3 entered beta
testing.

<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2013-March/020126.html>`_ the
intention to merge distribute and setuptools, and have the new name be "setuptools".

Beta releases are `currently available for download <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/downloads>`_.

setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils that allow
you to more easily build and distribute Python packages, especially ones that
have dependencies on other packages.

`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_


A built-package format for Python.

A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and the .whl
extension.  It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP 376 compatible
install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format.  Many packages will
be properly installed with only the “Unpack” step (simply extracting the file
onto sys.path), and the unpacked archive preserves enough information to
“Spread” (copy data and scripts to their final locations) at any later time.

The wheel project provides a bdist_wheel command for setuptools (requires
distribute >= 0.6.34).  Wheel files can be installed with a newer pip from
https://github.com/pypa/pip or with wheel’s own command line utility.

irc:#buildout

Buildout is a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and deploying
applications from multiple parts, some of which may be non-Python-based.  It
lets you create a buildout configuration and reproduce the same software later.

`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bento>`_

Bento is a packaging tool solution for python software, targeted as an
alternative to distutils, setuptools, distribute, etc....  Bento's philosophy is
reproducibility, extensibility and simplicity (in that order).
