Basics: Creating and Distributing Distributions
===============================================

If you have some useful Python modules that you think others might
benefit from, but aren't sure how to go about packaging them up and
distributing them, then this short document is for you. By the end of
it, you'll be a contributor to the :doc:`PyPI <pypi>`.

For a more detailed look at packaging a larger project, see this
:doc:`example <example>`.

Let's begin.


Background
==========

Suppose you have a couple of useful modules you'd like to share:
``towel_location.py`` and ``towel_utils.py``.  First thing to do is
come up with a CamelCase project name for them. Let's go with
"TowelStuff" since it seems appropriate and also it has not yet been
used on the `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.


Arranging your file and directory structure
===========================================

"TowelStuff" will be the name of our project and of our
:term:`distribution`. We should also come up with a package name
within which our modules will reside (to avoid naming conflicts with
other modules). For this example, there's only one package, so let's
reuse the project name and go with "towel_stuff".  Make the layout of
your project directory (described below) look like this::

    TowelStuff/
        bin/
        CHANGES.txt
        docs/
        LICENSE.txt
        MANIFEST.in
        README.txt
        setup.py
        towel_stuff/
            __init__.py
            towel_location.py
            towel_utils.py
            test/
                __init__.py
                test_towel_location.py
                test_towel_utils.py

Here's what you should do for each of those listed above:

* Put into ``bin`` any scripts you've written that use your
  towel_stuff and which you think would be useful for your users. If
  you don't have any, then remove the bin directory.

* For now, the CHANGES.txt file should only contain::

      v<version>, <date> -- Initial release.

  since this is your very first version (version number will be
  described below) and there are no changes to report.

* The docs dir should contain any design docs, implementation notes, a
  faq, or any other docs you've written. For now, stick to plain text
  files ending in ".txt". This author (JohnMG) likes to use `Pandoc's
  Markdown <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_, but many Pythoneers
  use `ReST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

* The LICENSE.txt file is often just a copy/paste of your license of
  choice.  We recommend going with a commonly-used license, such as
  the GPL, BSD, or MIT.

* The ``MANIFEST.in`` file should contain this::

      include *.txt
      recursive-include docs *.txt

* The README.txt file should be written in ReST so that the PyPI can
  use it to generate your project's PyPI page. Here's a 10-second intro
  to reST that you might use to start with::

      ===========
      Towel Stuff
      ===========

      Towel Stuff provides such and such and so and so. You might find
      it most useful for tasks involving <x> and also <y>. Typical usage
      often looks like this::

          #!/usr/bin/env python
          
          import towel_stuff.towel_location as ts_loc
          import towel_stuff.towel_utils    as ts_utils

          if not ts_utils.has_towel():
              print "Your towel is located:", ts_loc.where_is_my_towel()

      (Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)

      Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
      and ``monospace`` look like this.

      A Section
      =========

      Lists look like this:

      * First

      * Second. Can be multiple lines
        but must be indented properly.

      A Sub-Section
      -------------

      Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

      1. hi there

      2. must be going

      Urls are http://like.this and links can be
      written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.

  You might also consider adding a "Contributors" section and/or a
  "Thanks also to" section to list the names of people who's helped.

  By the way, to see how the above ``README.txt`` looks rendered in
  html, see the `TowelStuff project
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/TowelStuff/>`_ at the PyPI.

* setup.py -- Create this file and make it look like this::

      from distutils.core import setup

      setup(
          name='TowelStuff',
          version='0.1.0',
          author='J. Random Hacker',
          author_email='jrh@example.com',
          packages=['towel_stuff', 'towel_stuff.test'],
          scripts=['bin/stowe-towels.py','bin/wash-towels.py'],
          url='http://pypi.python.org/pypi/TowelStuff/',
          license='LICENSE.txt',
          description='Useful towel-related stuff.',
          long_description=open('README.txt').read(),
      )

  but, of course, replace the towel stuff with your own project and
  package names. For more details about picking version numbers, see
  :doc:`versioning`, but '0.1.0' will work just fine for a first
  release (this is using the very common "major.minor.bugfix"
  numbering convention).

  If you have no scripts to distribute (and no ``bin`` dir), you can
  remove the above line above starting with ``scripts``.

* Inside the ``towel_stuff`` directory, ``__init__.py`` can be
  empty. Likewise, inside ``towel_stuff/test``, *that* ``__init__.py``
  can be empty as well. If you have no tests written yet, you can
  leave the two other module files in ``towel_stuff/test`` empty for
  now too. When writing your tests, use the standard ``unittest``
  module.

For our example, TowelStuff does not depend upon any other
distributions (it only depends upon what's already in the Python
standard library). To specify dependencies upon other distributions,
see the more detailed :doc:`example`.


Creating your distribution file
===============================

Create your distribution file like so::

    cd path/to/TowelStuff
    python setup.py sdist

Running that last command will create a ``MANIFEST`` file in your
project directory, and also a ``dist`` and ``build`` directory. Inside
that ``dist`` directory is the distribution that you'll be uploading
to the PyPI. Feel free to poke around in the dist directory to look
at your distribution.


Uploading your distribution file
================================

Before uploading you first need to create an account at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi . Once that's complete, register your
distribution at the PyPI like so::

    cd path/to/TowelStuff
    python setup.py register

Use your existing login (choice #1). It will prompt you to save the
login info for future use (to which I agree). Then upload::

    python setup.py sdist upload

This builds the distribution one last time and then uploads it.

Thanks for your contribution!


Updating your distribution
==========================

Down the road, after you've made updates to your distribution and wish
to make a new release:

1. increment the version number in your ``setup.py`` file,
2. update your ``CHANGES.txt`` file,
3. if necessary, update the "Contributors" and "Thanks also to" sections
   of your ``README.txt`` file.
4. run ``python setup.py sdist upload`` again.
