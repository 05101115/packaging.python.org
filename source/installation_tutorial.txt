Global vs User vs Virtualenv
============================

The Python packaging tools can be installed at a number of locations, the
the primary difference being how widely localised the tools are on the target
system.

Installing globally
*******************

Global installation surfaces the packaging tools for all users of Python on the
system. Such an installation most often requires administrative privilege.

The following series of commands will install the Python packaging tools
globally; execute the following **with administrative privilege**::

 # install setuptools
 $ curl https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.7.8/ez_setup.py | python
 
 # install pip
 $ curl https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/1.3.X/contrib/get-pip.py | python

Installing for user
*******************

A user installation avoids altering system wide Python while providing the user
the means to install their own baseline of Python packaging tools.

A user installation does not require administrative privilege and is achieved
with the following commands::

 # install setuptools
 $ curl -O https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/0.7.8/ez_setup.py
 $ python ez_setup.py --user
 
 # install pip
 $ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.3.1.tar.gz
 $ tar xvfz pip-1.3.1.tar.gz
 $ cd pip-1.3.1
 $ python setup.py install --user

Installing in virtualenv
************************

The packaging tools are made available in an isolated Python environments
known as a :ref:`virtualenv` allowing packages to be easily installed into the
self-contained environment.

The basic tools are installed into the virtualenv when the environments are
created; please see the `Creating Virtual Environments`_ section below.
