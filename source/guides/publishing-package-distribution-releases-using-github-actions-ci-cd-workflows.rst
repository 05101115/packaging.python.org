Publishing package distribution releases using GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
=============================================================================

`GitHub Actions CI/CD`_ allows you to run a series of commands
whenever an event occurs on the GitHub platform. One
popular choice is having a workflow that's triggered by a
``push`` event.
This guide shows you how to publish a Python distribution
whenever a tagged commit is pushed.
It will use the `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish GitHub Action`_ for
publishing. It also uses GitHub's `upload-artifact`_ and `download-artifact`_ actions 
for temporarily storing and downloading the source packages.

.. attention::

   This guide *assumes* that you already have a project that you know how to
   build distributions for and *it lives on GitHub*.  This guide also avoids
   details of building platform specific projects. If you have binary
   components, check out :ref:`cibuildwheel`'s GitHub Action examples.

Configuring trusted publishing
==============================

This guide relies on PyPI's `trusted publishing`_ implementation to connect
to `GitHub Actions CI/CD`_. This is recommended for security reasons, since 
the generated tokens are created for each of your projects
individually and expire automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to generate an
`API token`_ for both PyPI and TestPyPI. In case of publishing to third-party
indexes like :doc:`devpi <devpi:index>`, you may need to provide a
username/password combination.

Since this guide will demonstrate uploading to both
PyPI and TestPyPI, we'll need two trusted publishers configured. 
The following steps will lead you through creating the "pending" publishers
for your new project. However it is also possible to add `trusted publishing`_
to any pre-existing project, if you are its owner.

Let's begin! ðŸš€

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/.
2. Fill in the name you wish to publish your new project under,
   your GitHub username and repository name and
   the name of the release workflow file under
   the ``.github/`` folder, see :ref:`workflow-definition`.
   Finally add the name of the GitHub Actions environment
   (``pypi``) we're going set up under your repository.
   Register the trusted publisher.
3. Now, go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and repeat
   the second step, but now enter ``testpypi`` as the name of the
   GitHub Actions environment.
4. Your "pending" publishers are now ready for their first use and will 
   create your projects automatically once you use them 
   for the first time.

   .. attention::

      If you don't have a TestPyPI account, you'll need to
      create it. It's not the same as a regular PyPI account.


.. _workflow-definition:

Creating a workflow definition
==============================

GitHub CI/CD workflows are declared in YAML files stored in the
``.github/workflows/`` directory of your repository.

Let's create a ``.github/workflows/publish-to-test-pypi.yml``
file.

Start it with a meaningful name and define the event that
should make GitHub run this workflow:

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :end-before: jobs:

This will also ensure that the release workflow is only triggered
if the current commit is tagged. It is recommended you use the
latest release tag; a tool like GitHub's dependabot can keep
these updated regularly.

Checking out the project and building distributions
===================================================

We will have to define two jobs to publish to PyPI 
and TestPyPI respectively, and an additional job to 
build the distribution packages.

First, we'll define the job for building the dist packages of 
your project and storing them for later use:

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: jobs:
   :end-before: Install pypa/build

This will download your repository into the CI runner and then
install and activate the newest available Python 3 release.

And now we can build the dists from source and store them.
In this example, we'll use the ``build`` package.
So add this to the steps list:

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: version: "3.x"
   :end-before: publish-to-pypi

Defining a workflow job environment
===================================

Now, let's add initial setup for our job that will publish to PyPI.
It's a process that will execute commands that we'll define later.
In this guide, we'll use the latest stable Ubuntu LTS version
provided by GitHub Actions. This also defines a GitHub Environment
for the job to run in its context and a URL to be displayed in GitHub's
UI nicely. Additionally, it allows aqcuiring an OpenID Connect token
which is mandartory that the ``pypi-publish`` actions needs to
implement secretless trusted publishing to PyPI.

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: name: python-package-distributions
   :end-before: steps:

Publishing the distribution to PyPI
===================================

Finally, add the following steps at the end:

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 41-48

This step uses the `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`_ GitHub
Action: after the stored distribution package has been 
downloaded by the `download-artifact`_ action, it uploads 
the contents of the ``dist/`` folder into PyPI unconditionally.
This job also signs the artifacts with Sigstore right after publishing them to PyPI.

Separate workflow for publishing to TestPyPI
============================================

Now, repeat these steps and create another job for
publishing to the TestPyPI package index under the ``jobs``
section:

.. literalinclude:: github-actions-ci-cd-sample/publish-to-test-pypi.yml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1

That's all, folks!
==================

Now, whenever you push a tagged commit to your Git repository remote
on GitHub, this workflow will publish it to PyPI.
And it'll publish any push to TestPyPI which is useful for
providing test builds to your alpha users as well as making
sure that your release pipeline remains healthy!
