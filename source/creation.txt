Creating a Package
==================

Packaging with Distribute
=========================

Packages built and distributed using ``setuptools`` (a package provided by Distribute_) look to the user like ordinary Python packages based on the ``distutils``. Your users don’t need to install or even know about setuptools in order to use them, and you don’t have to include the entire ``setuptools`` package in your distributions. By including just a single bootstrap module (an 8K .py file), your package will automatically download and install ``setuptools`` if the user is building your package from source and doesn’t have a suitable version already installed.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Distribute is only released as a source distribution.

It can be installed using easy_install or pip, and can be done so with the source tarball, the eggs distribution, or by using the distribute_setup.py script provided online.

distribute_setup.py is the simplest and preferred way on all systems.

distribute_setup.py
Download distribute_setup.py and execute it, using the Python interpreter of your choice.

If your shell has the curl program you can do:

$ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
$ python distribute_setup.py
Notice this file is also provided in the source release.

easy_install or pip
Run easy_install or pip:

$ easy_install -U distribute
$ pip install distribute
If you want to install the latest dev version, you can also run:

$ easy_install -U distribute==dev
