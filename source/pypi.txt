========================
The Python Package Index
========================

The Python Package Index (PyPI), formely known as the Cheeseshop, is to Python
what CPAN is to Perl: a central repository of projects and
:term:`distributions <distribution>`.

PyPI is located at http://pypi.python.org and contains more than 8000 projects
registered by developers from the community.

<SCREENSHOT>

Tools like :doc:`Pip <pip>` or ``zc.buildout`` are using PyPI as the default
location to find distributions to install. When ``pip install Foo`` is called,
it will browse PyPI to find the latest available version of the ``Foo``
project using `The Simple Index Protocol`_. If it finds it, it will download
it and install it automatically.

This automatic installation ala apt-get will work only if the distribution
is a Distutils-based structure containing a ``setup.py`` file.

This involves that any serious Python project should use Distutils
(see the :doc:`basics <basics_creating_distributing_dists>` for doing this)
and should at the minimum be registered at PyPI. Uploading releases there is
also a good practice.

Registering projects
====================

Registering a project at PyPI is done by using Distutils' ``register`` command.
This command performs a simple HTTP post using a basic authentication.
It will use for that the login name and password stored in the ``.pypirc`` file
located in your home directory. This login has to be registered at PyPI, so
you need to go there and create an account.

Another option is to call ``register`` once on any Distutils-based project.
It will register the new account for you and all you'll have to do is to reply
to the confirmation e-mail PyPI will send you::

    $ python setup.py register
    running register
    warning: register: missing required meta-data: version
    We need to know who you are, so please choose either:
    1. use your existing login,
    2. register as a new user,
    3. have the server generate a new password for you (and email it to you), or
    4. quit
    Your selection [default 1]:
    ...

Once this is done, ``register`` will ask you if you want to save your login
information in the ``.pypirc`` file. By default, this will store the login name
**and** the password::

    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        pypi

    [pypi]
    username:tarek
    password:sigourney_as_an_avatar_is_scary

For security reasons, starting at Python 2.6, you can remove the password from
the file if you want ``register`` to prompt you to type it everytime.

.. note::

    A recent GSOC project called Keyring was done in 2009 in order
    to use any available system keyring like KWallet or KeyChain to
    be able to store the PyPI password there. The project was coded
    and once its proven to be mature enough, it might be used in Distutils
    ``register`` and ``upload`` commands.

    See: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring

Once your account is ready, registering it at PyPI will create among other
things a new web page there, using the metadata fields of your project.

- **name** will be used as the unique identifier in PyPI. For example, if
  your project's name is ``Foo``, its page will be located at
  `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/foo`. The rule at PyPI is `first in, first
  served`, meaning that once you have registered the `Foo` project, your
  login is the owner of the PyPI `foo` identifier and no one else (unless
  you authorize them) will be able to register a project under that name.

- **long_description** will be used to
  fill that page. An Html to :term:`reStructuredText` rendered will be used
  on the field before it is displayed.

A good practice is to use reST, and make sure your ``long_description``
field doesn't contain any reStructuredText syntax error. See
:ref:`rest_example` for a quick introduction on how to write a reSt compatible field.

To perform a check, install ``docutils`` by using Pip
(``pip install docutils``) and run::

    $ python setup.py --long-description | rst2html.py > /dev/null

Under Windows, make sure the sys.prefix + 'Scripts/' path is in the ``PATH``
environment variable and run::

    $ python.exe setup.py --long-description | rst2html.py > dummy.html

If you text contains any reSt error or warning, they will be displayed.

Starting at Python 2.7, you can use the ``check`` command instead of calling
the ``rst2html.py`` script, as long as ``docutils`` is installed::

    $ python setup.py check

The check command will check that all fields are compliant before you
register the project at PyPI.


Uploading distributions
=======================

PyPI also allows developer to upload their project's distributions. This can
be done manually via a web form, but also through Distutils by using the
``upload`` command.

This command will upload freshly created archives via HTTP to PyPI. The
usual way to perform this is to call ``upload`` right after ``register``
and the commands used to create archives. For instance, to upload a source
distribution and update the project's page, one may do::

    $ python setup.py register sdist upload

Note that you can upload several archives in one step if wanted::

    $ python setup.py register sdist bdist upload


A good practice when uploading distributions at PyPI is to always upload
the source distribution, unless your project is not open source of course.
Binary distribution are optional especially if your project doesn't contain
any extension to be compiled. This will help automatic installers like
:doc:`Pip <pip>` to get and install your project on any platform. Uploading
only a binary distribution will restrict automatic installation to the platform
and Python version it was compiled with.


The Simple Index protocol
=========================

Besides its web pages, PyPI provides a tree structure at
http://pypi.python.org/simple called the ``Simple Index``. This structure
allows installers like :doc:`Pip <pip>` to look for distribution archives.

For example, calling::

    $ pip install distribute

Will look at the ``http://pypi.python.org/simple/distribute`` page, which
is a list of URLs for the Distribute project. These URLs are:

- the Distribute archives uploaded at PyPI
- a link to the project's home page
- extra links contained in the project's description fields

The Package Index follows these rules (taken from Setuptools' documentation):

1. Its pages are in HTML

2. Individual project version pages' URLs must be of the form
   ``base/projectname/version``, where ``base`` is the package index's base
   URL. The base URL for PyPI is : ``http://pypi.python.org/simple``.

3. Omitting the ``/version`` part of a project page's URL (but keeping the
   trailing ``/``) should result in a page that is either:

   a) The single active version of that project, as though the version had been
      explicitly included, OR

   b) A page with links to all of the active version pages for that project.

   Depending on the project's configuration, PyPI will display a) or b).

4. Individual project version pages should contain direct links to downloadable
   distributions where possible.  The project's "long_description" field
   may contain URLs that will be displayed.

5. Where available, MD5 information should be added to download URLs by
   appending a fragment identifier of the form ``#md5=...``, where ``...`` is
   the 32-character hex MD5 digest.

6. Individual project version pages should identify any "homepage" or
   "download" URLs using ``rel="homepage"`` and ``rel="download"`` attributes
   on the HTML elements linking to those URLs. Use of these attributes will
   cause EasyInstall to always follow the provided links, unless it can be
   determined by inspection that they are downloadable distributions. If the
   links are not to downloadable distributions, they are retrieved, and if they
   are HTML, they are scanned for download links. They are *not* scanned for
   additional "homepage" or "download" links, as these are only processed for
   pages that are part of a package index site.

7. The root URL of the index, if retrieved with a trailing ``/``, must result
   in a page containing links to *all* projects' active version pages.

   (Note: This requirement is a workaround for the absence of case-insensitive
   ``safe_name()`` matching of project names in URL paths. If project names are
   matched in this fashion (e.g. via the PyPI server, mod_rewrite, or a similar
   mechanism), then it is not necessary to include this all-packages listing
   page.)

8. If a package index is accessed via a ``file://`` URL, then EasyInstall will
   automatically use ``index.html`` files, if present, when trying to read a
   directory with a trailing ``/`` on the URL.
