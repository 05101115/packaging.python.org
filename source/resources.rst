Additional Resources we deem might be helpful.


1. For those looking for a more comprehensive guide to "How do I publish my
   Python project in a way that will make it as easy as possible for me to
   maintain and for others to contribute?", then Jeff Knupp's `Open Sourcing a
   Python Project the Right Way
   <http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/>`__
   is an excellent guide that is up to date with the currently available tools
   (as of September, 2013). Even for those not looking for a step-by-step guide,
   Jeff's post provides some links to some excellent resources.

.. [1] So many links we could add here.  We don't have to vouch for every word
       in these links, just want to narrow things down more than users googling.
