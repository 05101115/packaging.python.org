Python Packaging User Guide
===========================

:Last Reviewed: 2014-01-22

The "Python Packaging User Guide" (PUG) aims to be the authoritative resource on
how to package and install Python distributions using current tools, but also on
the efforts to improve Python packaging. The guide is part of a larger effort to
improve all of the packaging and installation docs, including :ref:`pip`,
:ref:`setuptools`, :ref:`virtualenv`, :ref:`wheel`, :ref:`distlib`, and
`docs.python.org`_.

For user support related to a specific project, see the mailing list and IRC
links on the :doc:`Projects <projects>` page. For something more general, or
when you're just not sure, use the `distutils-sig
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig>`_ list.


The guide is maintained `here
<https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide>`_ by the :term:`Python
Packaging Authority (PyPA)`.
