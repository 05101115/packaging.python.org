Python Packaging User Guide
===========================

:Last Reviewed: 2014-01-22

The "Python Packaging User Guide" (PUG) aims to be the authoritative resource on
how to package and install distributions in Python using current tools, but also
on the efforts to improve Python packaging.

The guide is part of a larger effort to improve all of the packaging and
installation docs, including :ref:`pip`, :ref:`setuptools`, :ref:`virtualenv`,
:ref:`wheel`, :ref:`distlib`, and `docs.python.org`_. Ultimately, users need
more than a guide to feel confident about the current tools. They need complete,
accurate and inter-consistent documentation across all the projects.

The guide is maintained `here
<https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide>`_ by the :term:`Python
Packaging Authority (PyPA)`.  It was forked from the “Hitchhikers Guide to
Packaging” in March 2013.
