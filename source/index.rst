Python Packaging User Guide

The "Python Packaging User Guide" aims to be the authoritative resource on how
to package and install distributions in Python.

The guide is part of a larger effort to improve all of the packaging and
installation docs, including :ref:`pip`, :ref:`setuptools`, :ref:`virtualenv`,
and :ref:`wheel`. Ultimately, users need more than a guide to feel confident
about the current tools. They need complete, accurate and inter-consistent
documentation across all the projects.

The guide is maintained `here
<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide>`_ by the :term:`Python
Packaging Authority (PyPA)`.  It was forked from the “Hitchhikers Guide to
Packaging” in March 2013.
