You'll need `virtualenv`_, `pip`_, and `setuptools`_, in order to package and
install python software the way that is recommended in the tutorials.

.. _`Recommended Procedure`:

Recommended Procedure
---------------------

We recommend the following installation procedure for these reasons:

* It doesn't require administrator access.
* It doesn't modify your system Python which can possibly result in system failures.
* It's simple and gives you the flexibility to work from any python installed on
  your system.
* You'll end up with versions of pip, virtualenv, and setuptools that have been
  tested together.

It involves using `virtualenv`_ to create isolated environments that contain pip
and `setuptools`_.

Get virtualenv
++++++++++++++

Download the latest virtualenv from here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/

The file you'll be downloading will be of the form "virtualenv-X.Y.tar.gz"

.. warning::

    You must use virtualenv>=1.9.1 (which contains pip>=1.3.1) to ensure pip
    verifies certificates over SSL when installing.

Unpack the downloaded file and place the contents into your home directory (or
user directory on Windows), or other directory of your choice.

We will not be *installing* virtualenv.


Create an environment
+++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming the following:

* On linux/OSX, your python interpreter of choice is available as "pythonX.Y"
* On Windows, your python interpreter of choice is available as "c:\\PythonXY\\python"
* In your console, you are in the directory you unpacked the download file into.

Then use virtualenv, like so, to create a virtual environment (that contains pip
and setuptools).

E.g, in this case, we'll be creating an environment labeled
"myVE", short for "my virtual environment".

On linux/OSX::

   $ pythonX.Y virtualenv-X.Y/virtualenv.py myVE

On Windows::

   $ c:\pythonXY\python virtualenv-X.Y/virtualenv.py myVE


Use the environment
+++++++++++++++++++

To use the `myVE` environment, activate it like so.

On linux/OSX::

   $ source myVE/bin/active

On Windows::

   $ myVE\Scripts\activate.bat


As a result, the following will be true:

* ``pip`` will be on your path, and will install packages to the `myVE` environment.
* ``setup.py`` files that import `setuptools`, will be importing from the :ref:`setuptools` distribution installed in `myVE`.



.. _`Advanced Procedure`:

Advanced Procedure
------------------

Although we recommend the vitualenv approach above, there are cases where a user
might want to install `pip`_ and `setuptools`_ globally for a python install on
their system, and bypass using `virtualenv`_.  In that case, use the procedures
below to install or upgrade `setuptools`_ and `pip`_.


Install or Upgrade Setuptools
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To install setuptools from scratch, download `ez_setup.py` from here:
https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py.

Then run it like so::

   $ python ez_setup.py


To upgrade a previous install of setuptools or distribute, there are two scenarios.

1. You currently have setuptools or distribute *and* some version of pip::

   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools

   If you have distribute, this will upgrade to you distribute-0.7.X, which is
   just a wrapper, that depends on setuptools. The end result will be that you
   have distribute-0.7.X (which does nothing) *and* the latest setuptools
   installed.

2. You currently have setuptools or distribute, but not pip:

   Follow the pip install procedure below, then come back and run::

   $ pip install --upgrade setuptools


Install or Upgrade pip
++++++++++++++++++++++

Download `get-pip.py` from here: https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py

Then run the following (which may require administrator access), to install or upgrade to the
latest pip::

 $ python get-pip.py

.. note::

    As of pip 1.4, pip recommends `setuptools`_ >=0.8, not `distribute`_ (a
    fork of setuptools) and the wheel support *requires* `setuptools`_ >=0.8.
    `setuptools`_ and `distribute`_ are now merged back together as
    "setuptools".
