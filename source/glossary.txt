   Developer
       The person developing the package.

   distribution
       A Python distribution is a versioned software archive file
       that contains Python packages, modules, and other
       files. They're preferably named using CamelCase, for example,
       "DeepThought". A distribution's contents can be installed into
       your Python installation by using Distutils' install command
       (i.e. ``python setup.py install``) or Distutils-based
       installers (for example, pip).

   distutils
       A standard and basic package that comes with the Python
       standard library. It is used for creating distributions
       (where it is imported in the ``setup.py`` file for that
       distribution).

   module
       A python source code file (ex. ``mymodule.py``), most often
       found in a package (``mypackage/mymodule.py``). You can import
       a module: ``import mymodule``, or ``import mypackage.mymodule``
       if it lives in ``mypackage``.

   package
       A directory containing an ``__init__.py`` file (ex.
       ``mypackage/__init__.py``), and also usually containing
       modules (possibly along with other packages). You can import
       a package: ``import mypackage``

   package index
       An index of packages that is a listing of packages in that index. Optionally the index can provide an XML-RPC API for package discovery and consumption.

       .. seealso:: The :ref:`pypi_info` is the default packaging index for the Python community. It is open to all Python developers to consume and distribute their packages.

   Packager
       The person packaging the package for a particular operating system
       (e.g. Debian).

   reStructuredText
       A plain text format used in many Python projects for documenation. The
       reStructuredText format is used in this document. For more information,
       please see the `reStructuredText Documentation 
       <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

   standard library
       Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of
       facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The
       library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to
       system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be
       inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python
       that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
       everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to
       encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting
       away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

   tarball
       An archive format for collected a group of files together as one. The
       format's extension is usually ``.tar``, which represents it's meaning,
       Tape ARchive. The format is often used in conjunction with a
       compression format such as gzip or bzip.
