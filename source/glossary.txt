   Developer
       The person developing the package.

   distribution
       A Python distribution is a versioned software archive file
       that contains Python packages, modules, and other
       files. They're preferably named using CamelCase, for example,
       "DeepThought". A distribution's contents can be installed into
       your Python installation by using Distutils' install command
       (i.e. ``python setup.py install``) or Distutils-based
       installers (for example, pip).

   distutils
       A standard and basic package that comes with the Python
       standard library. It is used for creating distributions
       (where it is imported in the ``setup.py`` file for that
       distribution).

   module
       A python source code file (ex. ``mymodule.py``), most often
       found in a package (``mypackage/mymodule.py``). You can import
       a module: ``import mymodule``, or ``import mypackage.mymodule``
       if it lives in ``mypackage``.

   package
       A directory containing an ``__init__.py`` file (ex.
       ``mypackage/__init__.py``), and also usually containing
       modules (possibly along with other packages). You can import
       a package: ``import mypackage``

   package index
       An index of packages that is a listing of packages in that index. Optionally the index can provide an XML-RPC API for package discovery and consumption.

       .. seealso:: The :doc:`pypi` is the default packaging index for the Python community. It is open to all Python developers to consume and distribute their packages.

   Packager
       The person packaging the package for a particular operating system
       (e.g. Debian).

   reStructuredText
       A plain text format used in many Python projects for documenation. The
       reStructuredText format is used in this document. For more information,
       please see the `reStructuredText Documentation 
       <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

   tarball
       An archive format for collected a group of files together as one. The
       format's extension is usually ``.tar``, which represents it's meaning,
       Tape ARchive. The format is often used in conjunction with a
       compression format such as gzip or bzip.
