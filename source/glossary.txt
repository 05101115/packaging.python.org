    distributions
        A Python distribution is a versioned software archive file
        that contains Python packages, modules, and other files. A
        distribution can be installed into your Python installation by
        using Distutils' install command (i.e. ``python setup.py
        install``) or Distutils-based installers (for example, pip).
