    distribution
        A Python distribution is a versioned software archive file
        that contains Python packages, modules, and other
        files. They're preferably named using CamelCase, for example,
        "DeepThought". A distribution's contents can be installed into
        your Python installation by using Distutils' install command
        (i.e. ``python setup.py install``) or Distutils-based
        installers (for example, pip).

    distutils
        A standard and basic package that comes with the Python
        standard library. It is used for creating distributions
        (where it is imported in the ``setup.py`` file for that
        distribution).

    module
        A python source code file (ex. ``mymodule.py``), most often
        found in a package (``mypackage/mymodule.py``). You can import
        a module: ``import mymodule``, or ``import mypackage.mymodule``
        if it lives in ``mypackage``.

    package
        A directory containing an ``__init__.py`` file (ex.
        ``mypackage/__init__.py``), and also usually containing
        modules (possibly along with other packages). You can import
        a package: ``import mypackage``
