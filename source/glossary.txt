    distribution
        A Python distribution is a versioned software archive file
        that contains Python packages, modules, and other
        files. They're preferably named using CamelCase, for example,
        "DeepThought". A distribution's contents can be installed into
        your Python installation by using Distutils' install command
        (i.e. ``python setup.py install``) or Distutils-based
        installers (for example, pip).

    distutils
        A standard and basic package that comes with the Python
        standard library. It is used for creating distributions
        (where it is imported in the ``setup.py`` file for that
        distribution).

    module
        A python source code file (ex. ``some_module.py``), most often
        found in a package (``some_package/some_module.py``). You can
        import these: ``import some_package.some_module``

    package
        A directory containing an ``__init__.py`` file, and also
        usually containing modules (possibly along with other
        packages). You can import these: ``import some_package``
