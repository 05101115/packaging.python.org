Introduction to Packaging
=========================

Python is known for it's "batteries included" philosophy and has a
rich standard library. However, being a popular language, the number
of third party packages is much higher than the number of things in
the standard library. 

It can be tedious to manually install extra packages that one needs
and therefore, Python has a packaging system that allows people to
distribute their programs and libraries in a standard format that
makes it easy to install and use them.

This document describes the way in which the packaging system works
and how you as a developer can :doc:`create packages </creation>` or as a
user can :doc:`install packages <installation>`. However, in order to
do this, first we must describe where Python looks for libraries.

Python file layout

Here's a diagram showing the layout of the files in a normal
installation of Python.
