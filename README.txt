The "Python Packaging User Guide" is a guide focusing on current
best-practices for working with Python distributions (third-party
software distributions of Python packages and modules). It covers
finding, installing, creating, and distributing packages, as well as
other aspects of the Python module packaging ecosystem.

All chapters of the Guide are written in [reStructuredText][1] format,
and the Guide itself is built using the [Sphinx][2] documentation
tool.

The html version of the Guide is currently available at
<https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org>.
