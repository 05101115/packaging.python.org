The "Python Packaging User Guide" is a guide focusing on current
best-practices for working with Python distributions (third-party
software distributions of Python packages and modules). It covers
finding, installing, creating, and distributing packages, as well as
other aspects of the Python module packaging ecosystem.

This guide is a fork from the original "Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging",
which was previously maintained by Tarek Ziad√©.  Thankyou Tarek for all
your efforts in python packaging.
